## Market Size Estimation:
Research and estimate the potential market size for food delivery in the chosen city.

## Unit Economics:
Calculate profitability per order based on estimated costs and revenues.

## Conclusions & KPIs:
- Decide whether to launch based on the previous analyses.
- Propose KPIs to measure success or failure post-launch.

For the analysis, we have chosen a hypothetical city: **New York City (NYC)**. NYC is renowned for its dense population, diverse culinary scene, and a high potential for food delivery services.

### 1. Top-down Estimation of Market Size:

To estimate the market size, the following steps are followed:

- **Determine the Target Population**: Calculate the potential number of customers in NYC.
- **Penetration Rate**: Estimate the percentage of the population that might use food delivery services.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Estimate the average spend per order.
- **Order Frequency**: Estimate how often an average customer might order in a month.

Using these estimates, the formula for potential market size is:

Potential Market Size = Target Population x Penetration Rate x AOV x Order Frequency.


### 2. Unit Economics with Profitability per Order:

**Revenue**: Driven by the price charged to the customer.

**Costs**:

- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Cost of the food.
- **Delivery Costs**: Payment to the delivery personnel.
- **Operational Costs**: Platform maintenance, customer support, etc.
- **Marketing Costs**: Costs incurred to acquire a customer.

Profitability per order can be calculated as:

Profitability per Order = Revenue - (COGS + Delivery Costs + Operational Costs + Marketing Costs).


### 3. Conclusions:
Based on the market size and profitability per order, we can determine the feasibility of launching the service.

### 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: Number of unique users using the service monthly.
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: The cost to acquire a new customer.
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: The net profit from a customer throughout their relationship with the service.
- **Order Frequency**: Frequency at which a customer places an order.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**.
- **Churn Rate**: Percentage of customers who discontinue the service.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: A measure of customer satisfaction.

    "\n",
    "**Top-Down Estimation of Market Size**\n",
    "- **Population:** Nairobi has a population of approximately 4.4 million people.\n",
    "- **Target Market:** Assuming that 30% of Nairobi's population represents the target market for food delivery (urban, tech-savvy individuals, middle and upper class), that's 1.32 million potential customers.\n",
    "- **Frequency:** If each person orders food delivery twice a month, that's 2.64 million orders a month.\n",
    "- **Average Order Value (AOV):** Based on averages from similar markets, I'll assume an AOV of $5. This gives a potential monthly revenue of $13.2 million for Nairobi."

# Taxi Upfront Pricing Precision

### Introduction
In the ever-competitive world of ride-sharing and taxi services, precision in estimating ride costs is paramount. This project revolves around enhancing the accuracy of a taxi app's upfront pricing algorithm by leveraging refined data points for pickup and drop-off locations. Through this effort, the upgraded version of the app aims to offer a more transparent and accurate fare estimation.

### Objective
To refine the fare estimation algorithm, reducing discrepancies between the estimated fare and the actual fare.
To improve user trust and satisfaction by providing a more precise upfront price.

### Data
The dataset comprises:
- Pickup and drop-off coordinates
- Distance and estimated time of travel
- Historical fare data for similar routes
- Time of day, day of the week, and special events

### Methodology
- Data Cleaning: Removed outliers and rectified erroneous entries (e.g., incorrect coordinates or negative fares).
- Feature Engineering: Created new variables, such as peak hour flag, weekday/weekend, and public event proximity.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns related to fare discrepancies and potential factors causing them.

### Results
Achieved a reduction in fare estimation discrepancies by X%.
Observed an increase in user trust metrics post-implementation, with fewer complaints related to fare discrepancies.

### Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

### Setup & Installation
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Future Scope
- Incorporation of real-time traffic data to further improve fare estimation.
- Analysis of user feedback post-ride to continuously refine the pricing model.
